# My Data Learning Journey
This repository documents my ongoing learning path in data engineering and data science, including hands-on notebooks, analysis projects, and certificates from Kaggle, DataCamp, and other platforms.

Growing in data engineering is not a single moment — it’s a consistent practice of learning, experimenting, and improving.
Every completed course represents:

- One more skill learned

- One more challenge completed

- One more step closer to becoming a stronger data professional

I’m using this repository to keep myself accountable and to show real, measurable progress.
Day by day, course by course, I’m building the foundation for a career in data engineering.
